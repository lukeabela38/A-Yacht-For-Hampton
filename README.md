# A-Yacht-For-Hampton 🥚⚓

Welcome aboard! This is the official landing page for Hampton's luxury yacht - a distinguished gentleman with an egg for a head who has dedicated his life to the art of luxury sailing. *Don't worry, we're not yolking around here!*

## Overview

Experience the most *eggsciting* maritime adventure on the web! This landing page features Hampton, a unique character with an egg-shaped head, sailing his magnificent yacht across animated ocean waters. But beware - even the smoothest sailing can hit rough waters, and Hampton's egg might just crack under pressure!

## Working Features ✨

- **Animated Yacht & Hampton Character**: Beautifully crafted CSS animations showing Hampton sailing his yacht with smooth floating motions
- **Thunderstorm Animation**: Click "Weather the Storm" to witness a dramatic thunderstorm sequence with:
  - Dark storm clouds rolling in
  - Animated rain effects
  - Lightning flashes with sound effects
  - Rough storm waves
  - Violent yacht rocking
  - **Egg Cracking Animation**: Watch as Hampton's egg head progressively cracks and breaks apart during the storm!
- **Sign-up Counter**: A live counter pane showing continuously increasing sign-ups (fake numbers, but *eggcellent* for social proof!)
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Smooth Scrolling Navigation**: Elegant navigation with smooth scroll effects
- **Contact Form**: Functional contact form for booking voyages with Hampton
- **Ocean Background**: Animated ocean waves creating a realistic maritime atmosphere
- **Feature Cards**: Interactive feature cards with hover effects
- **Easter Eggs**: Click on Hampton's egg head for a surprise spin animation!

## Known Bugs 🐛

- **Egg Cracking State**: Once Hampton's egg cracks during the thunderstorm, it doesn't automatically reset. You'll need to refresh the page to see the intact egg again. *We're working on a shell-repair feature!*
- **Thunder Sound on Mobile**: Web Audio API thunder effects may not work on all mobile browsers due to autoplay restrictions
- **Parallax During Storm**: Parallax scrolling is disabled during storms (by design), but the transition back can sometimes be jarring
- **Rain Performance**: On older devices, the 200+ rain drops might cause slight performance issues. *It's raining cats and dogs, but mostly code!*
- **Counter Overflow**: The sign-up counter doesn't have a maximum limit - it will keep counting indefinitely. *We're not scrambling to fix this one!*
- **Storm Button State**: If you click the storm button multiple times rapidly, it might cause animation conflicts. *Don't egg it on!*
